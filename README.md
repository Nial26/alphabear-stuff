##What is it?
Set of tools to help (cheat?) in the alphabear mobile game

##How to use it?

download the folder and do

`./alphabear_word_builder iodiosjdfiojsdio`

which will give you something like

```Longest Word Possible :  isidioid
Other Possible Words :  ['isidioid', 'diiodid', 'didos', 'dido', 'did', 'di', 'dd', 'd']```

---------------------------
###TODO

1. Clean up the word list
2. Add some preference mechanism to letters, which considers factors like which bear is chosen, which letter should be given preferences (like letters with 1 point should not be allowed to turn into stone) among other things
